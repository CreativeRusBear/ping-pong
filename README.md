## Introduction

**Ping-Pong** is computer video game that written by using `Canvas` API. 

It's also `Progressive Web Application` (`PWA`). So it allows you to install it as a native application on your devices. It also allows you to play in offline format (without network connection).

## About application

This application is created using :bookmark_tabs: :
 * `HTML` - hypertext markup language;
 * `CSS` - style sheet language;
 * `JavaScript` - programming language;
 * `Web App Manifest` - is a `JSON` document that provides application metadata for `Progressive Web Apps`;
 * `Service Worker` - is an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path. It takes the form of a `JavaScript` file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete control over how your app behaves in certain situations (the most obvious one being when the network is not available).;
