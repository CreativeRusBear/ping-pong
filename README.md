## Introduction

**Ping-Pong** is computer video game, written using `Canvas`. 
It's a `Progressive Web Application` (`PWA`), that allows you to install it as a Native Application on your device. It also allows you to play offline (without network connection).

## About application

This application is created using :bookmark_tabs: :
 * `HTML` - hypertext markup language;
 * `CSS` - style sheet language;
 * `JavaScript` - programming language;
 * `Web App Manifest` - is a `JSON` document that provides application metadata for `Progressive Web Apps`;
 * `Service Worker` - is an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path. It takes the form of a `JavaScript` file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete control over how your app behaves in certain situations (the most obvious one being when the network is not available).;
